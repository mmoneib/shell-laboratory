This text may vary at any time in the future, so please don't treat it as immutable, sacred textm because if you do, you might well regret it in the future.

Additionally, it is important to note that the language in this text is meant to be bloated to fill as much lines as necessary for its functions. It is also meant to be not very comprehensive and the matters of style are not even considred. Even though it is not to a product of automated writing, this text was not written carefully, for if it were, it would have been much more informative and less coarse. It could have also included rhymes and figures of speech. Unfortunately, practicality was the only criteria considered in writing this text and would probably reman, at least, the main one for the time to come as it evolves to cover the testing of more requirements.

Hence, it might be not the best of texts, yet it is sure to be a useful one.
